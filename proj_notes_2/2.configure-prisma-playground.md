# Prisma Playground

We can switch our gatsby project to use Prisma's Playground IDE insteady of the native GraphiQL editor:

`package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "prima-dev": "GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE=playground gatsby develop",
  },
```

Now we can run our development environment using the new script:

```json
yarn prisma-dev
```

> **NOTE:** we can still access the native IDE, by running the standard develop command:
>
> ```
> gatsby develop
> ```
