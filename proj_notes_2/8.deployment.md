# Deployment

> **NOTE:** Before deploying our project we must ensure that we have done two things:
>
> 1. Create a `.env-production` file that references our production-ready api keys and other sensitive data.
> 2. Ensure that the .env-production file does not get commited into our repo
>
> `.gitignore`
>
> ```shell
> # dotenv environment variable files
> .env*
> .env.development
> .env.production
> ```



First step to Deployment is to ensure we're using some kind of version control, when using git, we'll need to create a new repository: https://github.com/new. 

> In our project we'll need to prepare our files for github:
>
> 1. **ensure there is a gitignore**: make sure the file is placed in the project root.
>
> ```shell
> touch .gitignore
> ```
>
> 2. **ignore all senstive files:** make sure all env vars, and node_modules are ignored at the least.
>
> `.gitignore`
>
> ```shell
> # Dependency directories
> node_modules/
> 
> # dotenv environment variable files
> .env*
> .env.development
> .env.production
> ```
>
> 3. **initialize git in project**
>
> ```shell
> git init -y
> ```
>
> 4. **stage current project**
>
> ```shell
> git add .
> ```
>
> 5. **commit current project**
>
> ```shell
> git commit -m "initial commit: pre-deployment"
> ```
>
> 6. **add the origin for the new repository**
>
> ```shell
> git remote add origin git@github.com:gaurangrshah/REMOVE.git
> ```
>
> 7. **push local changes to remove repo**
>
> ```shell
> git push -u origin master
> ```



> **Setup Netlify Account**

> **NOTE:** WE CAN PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTION BUILD COMMAND, BUILD FOLDER, AND ENV_VARS



## Continuous Deployment

Once we've completed this, netlify will build our website on its servers using our build command that we've provided. It will then serve the files that get generated in our `public/`. When we push updates to github, netlify will recieve those updates automatically, and will trigger a re-build of the entire website. This is referred to as `continuous deployment`

We can also integrate contentful into the process to allow contentful to trigger a re-build when our data changes on its servers:

Using the provided webhook, we can now add this url to our contentful admin account:

> SELECT WEBHOOKS FROM SETTINGS MENU - THEN CLICK "ADD A WEBHOOK"

> ONCE WE'VE ADDED A NAME AND THE ENDPOINT FOR THE WEBHOOK WE CAN CLICK "SAVE"



Now any updates to our data in contentful will automatically trigger a re-build via netlify.

> when the hook is triggered it gets logged within the webhook dashboard in contentful.
